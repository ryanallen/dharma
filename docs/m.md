Mandala Offerings Ngondro Retreat  
with Venerable Khenpo Tenzin  
October 13 - November 23  

Dear Ngondro Participants,  

Please do not share any links or zoom log in information with other practitioners who have not registered for the online class.  

We are delighted that you all will engage in the powerful practice of Mandala Offerings. Venerable Khenpo Tenzin will guide participants with instruction and commentary on this Ngondro practice through pre-recorded lecture sessions and three live Question and Answer sessions.  

On a weekly basis, participants must commit to watching a pre-recorded video. This retreat will be restricted to the participants and will not be accessible on our YouTube channel for the public.

FURTHER SUPPORT  

At the end of the retreat you will be sent a compilation of notes from the recorded teachings that was edited under Khenpo's guidance.  

PRACTICE MATERIALS NEEDED  

Venerable Khenpo Tenzin recommends that it is best to have two mandala sets. One on your shrine and one that you use for the mandala offering practice. You can fill the mandala set with gemstones, adding any small items that are precious to you. Or you can offer rice that has been washed in saffron water. Be sure to dry the rice thoroughly before adding it to the mandala set.  

COMMITMENT / SAMAYA  

The commitment you need to make in order to participate is to promise to do at minimum one session purely, with no distractions of any kind, every day starting from October 13 to November 23. Participants must commit to doing the entire retreat and watching the online class once a week for instruction. This retreat will be restricted to the participants and will not be accessible on our public YouTube channel.  

Venerable Khenpo Tenzin recognizes that each person’s conditions will vary and some may work full time, part time, or be retired. However at minimum you will be required to do one session of practice everyday for the Mandala Offering Ngondro retreat and work towards a total of 100,000 accumulations. Four sessions a day is traditional for a retreat and is best. Yet if you only have time to do 1, 2 or 3 sessions a day, that is also acceptable.  

If you are unable to complete 100,000 accumulations of the mandala portion by November 23, you may continue with your accumulations until you complete them. However you can only count repetitions if you are seated for a formal session, not when you are doing any other activities.

## The Excellent Path to Enlightenment: A Practice of the Preliminaries of the Fivefold Path of Mahāmudrā

In order to practice the common (outer), the uncommon (inner), and the special preliminaries, seated on a comfortable cushion, assume the essential points<sup>[3](#3)</sup> of body, speech, and mind. Think that your root guru, who embodies all buddhas, sits above your crown and looks upon you with great love.

<details id="3"><summary>Note <sup>3</sup></summary>The essential points of the body allude to the physical posture optimal for meditation, mostly referring to the sevenfold posture of Vairocana. The essential point of the speech refers to the ninefold expelling of stale breath to purify the winds. The essential point of the mind is to engender an altruistic intent of bodhicitta.</details><br>

### Supplication To Guru 

(*Recite three times.*)

Guru, please think of me!  
Guru, please think of me!  
Guru, please think of me!

Essence of all Buddhas of the three times; source of the holy Dharma of scripture and realization; master of the Sangha, the noble assembly; root guru, please think of me!

Great treasure of compassion and blessing, source of two siddhis, your enlightened activities grant every wish—root guru, please think of me!

Kind root guru, please think of me! Look upon me from the place of great bliss at the crown of my head! Let me see the face of dharmakāya—my natural awareness—and bring me to the state of buddhahood in this very life!

(*Recite extraction from Calling the Gurus from Afar by Jamgon Kongtrül Rinpoche*)

Alas! Sentient beings, like myself, marred by sins and evil karma...

### Generating Bodhicitta

(*Recite three times*)

All mother sentient beings, limitless as space—especially those enemies who hate me, obstructers who harm me, and those who create obstacles on my path to liberation and omniscience—may they experience happiness; be free from suffering; and swiftly may they attain precious, unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment!  

All mother sentient beings, limitless as space—especially those enemies who hate me, obstructers who harm me, and those who create obstacles on my path to liberation and omniscience—may they experience happiness; be free from suffering; and swiftly may they attain precious, unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment!

![alt text](../.imgs/offering-2.png)

For that purpose, until I attain buddhahood, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue. 

Until death, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue. 

From today until this time tomorrow, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue.

## 1. The Four Common, Outer Preliminaries
### 1.1 The Difficulty of Finding a Precious Human Body

Unless a true wish for liberation arises within you, your practice will not turn toward the Dharma. It will only turn toward the Dharma if you have a pure intention of renouncing saṃsāra. Therefore, reflect upon the freedoms and advantages of this precious human body that is so difficult to find, as an antidote to the deep-seated attachment to this life.

Now that I have found this excellent support of freedom and advantage, which in the future, will be difficult to find again, I must practice to attain the state of unsurpassed awakening in order to fulfill the benefit of others.


### 1.2 Death and Impermanence

As an antidote to sloth and laziness, reflect on the impermanence of life:

Since the demonic Lord of Death is the enemy that hates my precious body, death is certain, but its timing is unknown. Therefore, I must recognize my own impermanence and that of others.


### 1.3 The Shortcomings of Samsara

As an antidote to the belief that true happiness can be found within saṃsāric existence, reflect on the suffering of saṃsāra.

Wherever I am born in the realms of saṃsāra, I have no chance at finding [true] wellbeing. Therefore, without concern for worldly pleasures, I enter the path of nirvāṇa.


### 1.4 Karma, Cause and Effect

To make meaningful use of this body of freedom and advantage, reflect on karma, cause and effect.

To make this life of freedom and advantage meaningful, I renounce the three poisonous emotions and unwholesome deeds. I will exert myself in virtuous actions and will protect the samaya and vows of the three doors.

### 2.3 The Mandala Offering: the Method for Gathering the Two Accumulations


A sūtra says, “As long as one has not truly completed the two accumulations, one will not truly realize emptiness.” Furthermore, “The ultimate, innate wisdom is the mark that testifies to one having gathered the accumulations and purified obscurations.” Thus, it is crucial to gather the accumulations. While there are many methods for gathering the accumulations, the maṇḍala offering is supreme. A tantra says, “Through offering the entire billionfold universe, adorned with various desirable qualities, to all the buddhas in their pure realms, buddha wisdom is accomplished.” Thus, be diligent in the maṇḍala offering.

![alt text](../.imgs/tree.jpg)


#### 2.3.1 Visualizing the Field of Accumulation


In the space before me, in the center of a wish-granting tree that emerges from a lake, on a precious throne that sits beneath a lotus and moon, is Great Vajradhāra—the presiding master of all buddha families—surrounded by the ocean of accomplished Kagyü masters. In front is the Blessed Lord Chakrasaṃvara together with a host of yidam deities of the four and six classes of tantra. To his right are the buddhas of the three times, endowed with the major and minor marks, together with the thousand buddhas of this Fortunate Eon. Behind is the Great Mother of Transcendent Wisdom and volumes of sūtras and tantras, naturally echoing the sound of Dharma. To his left are the bodhisattva-protectors of the three families surrounded by the noble Sangha of Bodhisattvas. Surrounding everything are oceans of oath-bound protectors, gathering like billowing clouds.

In the presence of this visualized merit-field, think that you offer yourself, everything you own, the universe and all beings, and all the glories and riches of gods and humans.


#### 2.3.2 The Thirty-Sevenfold Maṇḍala Offering


![alt text](../.imgs/mandala.png)

Om̆̇ vajra bhumi ā hūm̆̇. The completely pure base is a golden ground<sup>[4](#4)</sup> full of power. Om̆̇ vajra reke ā hūm̆̇. It is surrounded by a circle of iron mountains. At its center is hūm̆̇, the king of mountains, Sumeru. In the east is Excellent Body<sup>[5](#5)</sup>; in the south, the land of the Jambu Tree<sup>[6](#6)</sup>; in the west, Wish-Fulfilling Cattle<sup>[7](#7)</sup>; in the north, Voice of Doom<sup>[8](#8)</sup>; toward<sup>[9](#9)</sup> the east, Body and Noble Body; toward the south, Tail Fan and Minor Tail Fan; toward the west, Tremulous and Great Destiny; toward the north, Voice of Doom and Satellite of Voice of Doom. There is also the mountain of jewels, the wish-granting tree, the wish-granting cow, the harvest that needs no toil, the precious wheel, the precious gem, the precious queen, the precious minister, the precious elephant, the precious supreme steed, the precious general, the great treasure vase, the goddess of beauty, the goddess of garlands, the goddess of song, the goddess of dance, the goddess of flowers, the goddess of incense, the goddess of light, the goddess of perfume, the sun, the moon, a precious parasol, and a banner of universal victory. In the center are the most exalted glories and riches of gods and humans, without exception. I offer this field of utter purity to the gurus, yidams, buddhas, bodhisattvas, ḍākas, ḍākinīs, and Dharma protectors. Please accept it with compassion for the benefit of beings. Having accepted it, please grant your blessings!

<details id="4"><summary>Note <sup>4</sup></summary>The maṇḍala is a symbolic representation of the universe. The universe is said to sit on a golden ground, at the center of which is Mount Meru. The world-systems orbit this cosmic mountain.</details>

An infinite array of worlds, each with four continents and the wealth of infinite oceans of realms—if I bring them all to mind and offer them without exception, please hold with compassion all the beings they contain! My body, enjoyments, and whatever I own—my aggregates, elements, and sense sources; my aspirations now and in times to come; as well as everything I grasp as “mine”—by offering them all, may I be blessed with the end of self-grasping! Completely liberated from the bounds of real and unreal—transcending the names and attributes of arising, cessation, and abiding; coming and going; affirmation and denial—the supreme maṇḍala is the natural state. By offering it, may I be blessed to attain the state of buddhahood!

om̆̇ guru deva ḍākinī ratna maṇḍala pratīccha svāhā

Thus offer.

![alt text](../.imgs/mandala.png)

All owned and unowned things of the infinite, billionfold universe in its totality, my own body, enjoyments, and all my possessions, I offer—holding nothing back—to the ocean of the rare and precious ones. May the self-grasping of all beings be thereby fully pacified! May all beings be endowed with bodhicitta, and may they instantly attain the state of buddhahood! 

This verse is to be accumulated.

![alt text](../.imgs/tree.jpg)

To the assembly of gurus with three kāyas perfectly complete, I make outer, inner, secret, and suchness offerings. Please accept this offering of my body, wealth, and all appearance and existence, and bestow the unsurpassed, supreme accomplishment!

At the end of this recitation, the field of accumulation dissolves into you. The fundamental nature of the one who offers, the recipient of the offering, and the offering itself transcend all names and characteristics. Rest briefly within this unaltered state of mahāmudrā—
the ultimate maṇḍala, which is the natural state.

[**Go to Dedication - all daily practices except the last -->**](#dedication-prayers)

### The Short Prayer to be Reborn in Blissful Land of Amitabha

Emaho! In the center is the wondrous Buddha Amitābha of Boundless Light. To his right is Chenrezig, the Lord of Great Compassion, and to his left is Vajrapāṇi, the Bodhisattva of Great Power. They are surrounded by buddhas and bodhisattvas, inconceivable in number—limitless peace and happiness is the pure land of Great Bliss. As soon as I and others pass from this life, may we—unhindered by another saṃsāric birth—be born there and see the face of Amitābha, Boundless Light! May the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions bless this aspiration that it may be accomplished without hindrance!

tadyathā pañcandriya āwa bodhanāye svāhā

### Dedication Prayers

May bodhicitta, the precious and supreme mind, arise in whom it has not yet arisen! Where it has arisen, may it not decline, but ever increase higher and higher!

*(1st)* By this merit may I obtain omniscience or [at least] defeat the enemies—my wrongdoings—may I liberate all beings who are tossed in the ocean of saṃsāra by the waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death!

*(2nd)* Just as the hero Mañjushrī realized things as they are and as did Samantabhadra too, I will follow in their path by perfectly dedicating all of these virtues!

*(3rd)* By the blessing of the buddhas who attained the three kāyas, by the blessing of the truth of the unchanging nature of reality, and by the blessing of the undivided Sangha community, may my aspirations be fulfilled according to this dedication prayer!

By the virtues collected in the three times by myself and all beings in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, and by the intrinsic root of virtue, may I and all sentient beings quickly attain unsurpassed, perfect, complete, and precious awakening!

### The Long Life Prayer for His Holiness the Dalai Lama

For this realm encircled by snow-covered mountains, you are the source of all benefit and happiness without exception. Tenzin Gyatso, Lord Chenrezig, may you remain steadfast until the end of saṃsāra!

### The Long Life Prayer for His Holiness Chetsang Rinpoche

Embodiment of the Three Jewels, great being who upholds and increases the teachings of the Śhākya Lion, supreme are your activities of guiding others with your perfect deeds. May you, the precious guru, who accomplishes everything spontaneously, live long!

### The Long Life Prayer for His Holiness Chungtsang Rinpoche

Holder of the teachings of Lord Drikungpa, great lord of the Three Jewels, through the power of your peerless compassion
and the holy Dharma’s peace and light, you bring relief to beings. May your life be long!

### The Long Life Prayer for His Eminence Garchen Rinpoche

The one known in the Noble Land as Āryadeva, emanated into the Gar clan of Eastern Tibet as Chödingpa, the heart son of Jigten Gönpo—may the life of glorious Garchen remain steadfast for a hundred aeons!

In this degenerate age, when the Buddha’s teaching fades away, through his powerful, vajra-like conduct, he takes on himself the heavy responsibility of the unbiased teaching. May Garchen, the Sun of the Teaching, live long!

I pray for the excellent health of the guru! I pray that he lives a supremely long life! I pray that his activities spread far and wide! Grant blessings that I may not be separate from my guru!

In all the activities of the glorious guru, may wrong views not arise within me for even a moment, and through devotion that sees whatever he does as perfect, may the guru’s blessings enter my mind!

May all sentient beings have happiness, and may all the lower realms be permanently emptied! May the aspirations made by bodhisattvas of all bhūmis be accomplished!

### A Praying for Generating Dri-Kung Sect Written by Mi-Pam

May the teaching of the great Drikungpa Ratnaśhrī—Master of Interdependence, Omniscient Lord of Dharma, who has seen all knowable things—be upheld until the end of existence. May it be taught and accomplished through hearing, reflecting, and meditating!

May the Doctrine, only remedy for suffering, The source of every bliss and happiness, Be nurtured and upheld with reverence, And throughout a vast continuance of time, endure!
