Mandala Offerings Ngondro Retreat  
with Venerable Khenpo Tenzin  
October 13 - November 23  

Dear Ngondro Participants,  

Please do not share any links or zoom log in information with other practitioners who have not registered for the online class.  

We are delighted that you all will engage in the powerful practice of Mandala Offerings. Venerable Khenpo Tenzin will guide participants with instruction and commentary on this Ngondro practice through pre-recorded lecture sessions and three live Question and Answer sessions.  

On a weekly basis, participants must commit to watching a pre-recorded video. This retreat will be restricted to the participants and will not be accessible on our YouTube channel for the public.

FURTHER SUPPORT  

At the end of the retreat you will be sent a compilation of notes from the recorded teachings that was edited under Khenpo's guidance.  

PRACTICE MATERIALS NEEDED  

Venerable Khenpo Tenzin recommends that it is best to have two mandala sets. One on your shrine and one that you use for the mandala offering practice. You can fill the mandala set with gemstones, adding any small items that are precious to you. Or you can offer rice that has been washed in saffron water. Be sure to dry the rice thoroughly before adding it to the mandala set.  

COMMITMENT / SAMAYA  

The commitment you need to make in order to participate is to promise to do at minimum one session purely, with no distractions of any kind, every day starting from October 13 to November 23. Participants must commit to doing the entire retreat and watching the online class once a week for instruction. This retreat will be restricted to the participants and will not be accessible on our public YouTube channel.  

Venerable Khenpo Tenzin recognizes that each person’s conditions will vary and some may work full time, part time, or be retired. However at minimum you will be required to do one session of practice everyday for the Mandala Offering Ngondro retreat and work towards a total of 100,000 accumulations. Four sessions a day is traditional for a retreat and is best. Yet if you only have time to do 1, 2 or 3 sessions a day, that is also acceptable.  

If you are unable to complete 100,000 accumulations of the mandala portion by November 23, you may continue with your accumulations until you complete them. However you can only count repetitions if you are seated for a formal session, not when you are doing any other activities.
