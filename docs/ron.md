> Hello, I’m Ron Swanson, and this is your guided meditation. Sit down. Or stand. Frankly, I don’t care. Just be still, quiet, and resist the urge to fiddle with anything. Here we go.  


1. Paying Homage


> First, pay homage. That means you respect something greater than yourself. Could be nature, could be a well-made chair, or bacon. You choose. Take a moment to honor it. Bow your head if you want. But don’t bow too low. You’re still your own man—or woman.”


2. Making Offerings


> Now, make an offering. Not to me. To whatever you paid homage to. No need to get fancy. Offer something simple. Like a steak. Or a bottle of Lagavulin. If you’re in the woods, offer nature a firm handshake. It will appreciate your restraint.


3. Confessing Mistakes


> Next, we acknowledge mistakes. Yeah, we all make them. You burned a steak once. Or, God forbid, tried to eat tofu. Admit it. Learn from it. Never do it again. But don’t dwell on it. That’s weak.


4. Rejoicing in Virtue


> Now, rejoice in virtue. But keep it reasonable. You don’t need to celebrate everything. Maybe you didn’t yell at Jerry today. Or you sanded a table to perfection. Good job. Pat yourself on the back. But no need to make a scene about it.


5. Requesting Teachings


> Next, request teachings. Or as I call it, asking for advice. But only from someone who knows more than you do—which should be rare. If you can’t find anyone, sit in silence. The woods can teach you more than most people. Just listen.


6. Requesting the Teachers to Stay


> If you do find a good teacher, ask them to stick around. But don’t beg. Keep your dignity. Real wisdom is like a good steak—rare, hard to find, but worth the effort. Respect it, and maybe it’ll respect you back.


7. Dedicating Merit


> Finally, dedicate the merit. If you’ve done something right today, share the credit. Give a little to the world, even if the world is mostly annoying. Maybe dedicate it to the person who makes your breakfast. Or the trees. They’re good listeners.  
>  
> That’s it. Your meditation is over. Stand up. Or don’t. Just remember: like life, this is simple. Don’t overcomplicate things. Now go eat some bacon.
