## The Excellent Path to Enlightenment: A Practice of the Preliminaries of the Fivefold Path of Mahāmudrā

In order to practice the common (outer), the uncommon (inner), and the special preliminaries, seated on a comfortable cushion, assume the essential points<sup>[3](#3)</sup> of body, speech, and mind. Think that your root guru, who embodies all buddhas, sits above your crown and looks upon you with great love.

<details id="3"><summary>Note <sup>3</sup></summary>The essential points of the body allude to the physical posture optimal for meditation, mostly referring to the sevenfold posture of Vairocana. The essential point of the speech refers to the ninefold expelling of stale breath to purify the winds. The essential point of the mind is to engender an altruistic intent of bodhicitta.</details><br>

### Supplication To Guru 

(*Recite three times.*)

Guru, please think of me!  
Guru, please think of me!  
Guru, please think of me!

Essence of all Buddhas of the three times; source of the holy Dharma of scripture and realization; master of the Sangha, the noble assembly; root guru, please think of me!

Great treasure of compassion and blessing, source of two siddhis, your enlightened activities grant every wish—root guru, please think of me!

Kind root guru, please think of me! Look upon me from the place of great bliss at the crown of my head! Let me see the face of dharmakāya—my natural awareness—and bring me to the state of buddhahood in this very life!

(*Recite extraction from Calling the Gurus from Afar by Jamgon Kongtrül Rinpoche*)

Alas! Sentient beings, like myself, marred by sins and evil karma...

### Generating Bodhicitta

(Start of sessions 2-4)

(*Recite three times*)

All mother sentient beings, limitless as space—especially those enemies who hate me, obstructers who harm me, and those who create obstacles on my path to liberation and omniscience—may they experience happiness; be free from suffering; and swiftly may they attain precious, unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment!  

All mother sentient beings, limitless as space—especially those enemies who hate me, obstructers who harm me, and those who create obstacles on my path to liberation and omniscience—may they experience happiness; be free from suffering; and swiftly may they attain precious, unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment!

![alt text](.imgs/offering-2.png)

For that purpose, until I attain buddhahood, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue. 

Until death, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue. 

From today until this time tomorrow, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue.

## 1. The Four Common, Outer Preliminaries
### 1.1 The Difficulty of Finding a Precious Human Body

Unless a true wish for liberation arises within you, your practice will not turn toward the Dharma. It will only turn toward the Dharma if you have a pure intention of renouncing saṃsāra. Therefore, reflect upon the freedoms and advantages of this precious human body that is so difficult to find, as an antidote to the deep-seated attachment to this life.

Now that I have found this excellent support of freedom and advantage, which in the future, will be difficult to find again, I must practice to attain the state of unsurpassed awakening in order to fulfill the benefit of others.

### 1.2 Death and Impermanence

As an antidote to sloth and laziness, reflect on the impermanence of life:

Since the demonic Lord of Death is the enemy that hates my precious body, death is certain, but its timing is unknown. Therefore, I must recognize my own impermanence and that of others.

### 1.3 The Shortcomings of Samsara

As an antidote to the belief that true happiness can be found within saṃsāric existence, reflect on the suffering of saṃsāra.

Wherever I am born in the realms of saṃsāra, I have no chance at finding [true] wellbeing. Therefore, without concern for worldly pleasures, I enter the path of nirvāṇa.

### 1.4 Karma, Cause and Effect

To make meaningful use of this body of freedom and advantage, reflect on karma, cause and effect.

To make this life of freedom and advantage meaningful, I renounce the three poisonous emotions and unwholesome deeds. I will exert myself in virtuous actions and will protect the samaya and vows of the three doors.

![alt text](.imgs/offering-2.png)

## 2. The Four Uncommon, Inner Preliminaries

Of the four uncommon preliminaries, first, in order to be taken under the protection of the Three Jewels, one takes refuge. Since taking refuge is the entrance door to Buddhism, the benefits of taking refuge in the Three Jewels with fully trusting faith, free from any doubts, are inconceivable. The Condensed Perfection of Wisdom says, “If the merit of taking refuge had material form, even the three worlds would be too small to contain it.” The White Lotus Sūtra says, “Lay or ordained, those who have entered my teachings will, in this very fortunate eon, attain complete nirvāṇa without residue.”

![alt text](.imgs/tree.jpg)

### 2.1 Taking Refuge in the Three Jewels

Visualize the places of refuge with the intention of taking refuge in the Three Jewels for
the purpose of freeing all sentient beings, limitless as space, from saṃsāra, the ocean of
suffering.

In the space before me, in the center of a wish-granting tree that emerges from a lake, on a precious throne that sits beneath a lotus and moon, is the Guru, Vajradhāra—the presiding master of all buddha families—surrounded by the ocean of accomplished Kagyü masters. In front is the Blessed Lord Chakrasaṃvara together with a host of yidam deities of the four and six classes of tantra. To his right are the buddhas of the three times, endowed with the major and minor marks, together with the thousand buddhas of this Fortunate Eon. Behind is the Great Mother of Transcendent Wisdom and
volumes of sūtras and tantras, naturally echoing the sound of Dharma. To his left are the bodhisattva-protectors of the three families, surrounded by the assembly of the Three Vehicles’
noble Sangha. Surrounding everything are oceans of oath-bound protectors, gathering like billowing clouds.

Go for refuge thinking that “from now onwards, until attaining awakening, I and all limitless sentient beings take refuge and prostrate with respectful body, speech, and mind to the places of refuge visualized in front of me in this way”.

Namo! In the Buddha: dharmakāya, guru, and empty essence; in the Dharma: saṃbhogakāya, yidam, and clear nature; and in the Sangha: nirmāṇakāya, ḍākinī, and all-pervasive compassion, I take refuge until attaining awakening!

Through your blessings, may the minds of myself and all sentient beings, limitless as space, turn toward the Dharma! Through your blessings, may my Dharma become the path! Through your blessings, may the path dispel confusion! Through your blessings, may confused appearances arise as primordial wisdom!

By supplicating thus with intense devotion, the field of accumulation melts into the nature of five-colored lights, which then dissolve into you. Thus, imagine that your mind-stream is blessed, and rest for a while in the natural state without reference point
