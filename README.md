## The Excellent Path to Enlightenment: A Practice of the Preliminaries of the Fivefold Path of Mahāmudrā

In order to practice the common (outer), the uncommon (inner), and the special preliminaries, seated on a comfortable cushion, assume the essential points<sup>[3](#3)</sup> of body, speech, and mind. Think that your root guru, who embodies all buddhas, sits above your crown and looks upon you with great love.

<details id="3"><summary>Note <sup>3</sup></summary>The essential points of the body allude to the physical posture optimal for meditation, mostly referring to the sevenfold posture of Vairocana. The essential point of the speech refers to the ninefold expelling of stale breath to purify the winds. The essential point of the mind is to engender an altruistic intent of bodhicitta.</details><br>

### Supplication To Guru 

(*Recite three times.*)

Guru, please think of me!  
Guru, please think of me!  
Guru, please think of me!

Essence of all Buddhas of the three times; source of the holy Dharma of scripture and realization; master of the Sangha, the noble assembly; root guru, please think of me!

Great treasure of compassion and blessing, source of two siddhis, your enlightened activities grant every wish—root guru, please think of me!

Kind root guru, please think of me! Look upon me from the place of great bliss at the crown of my head! Let me see the face of dharmakāya—my natural awareness—and bring me to the state of buddhahood in this very life!

(*Recite extraction from Calling the Gurus from Afar by Jamgon Kongtrül Rinpoche*)

Alas! Sentient beings, like myself, marred by sins and evil karma...

### Generating Bodhicitta

(Start of sessions 2-4)

(*Recite three times*)

All mother sentient beings, limitless as space—especially those enemies who hate me, obstructers who harm me, and those who create obstacles on my path to liberation and omniscience—may they experience happiness; be free from suffering; and swiftly may they attain precious, unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment!  

All mother sentient beings, limitless as space—especially those enemies who hate me, obstructers who harm me, and those who create obstacles on my path to liberation and omniscience—may they experience happiness; be free from suffering; and swiftly may they attain precious, unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment!  

All mother sentient beings, limitless as space—especially those enemies who hate me, obstructers who harm me, and those who create obstacles on my path to liberation and omniscience—may they experience happiness; be free from suffering; and swiftly may they attain precious, unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment!  

For that purpose, until I attain buddhahood, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue. 

Until death, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue. 

From today until this time tomorrow, I will apply my body, speech, and mind to virtue.
